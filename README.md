# XSS-CHECKER
Xss checker checks whether the target has xss vulnerabilities!

## XSS?
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a web security vulnerability that lets attackers inject malicious JavaScript into webpages. When users visit the affected page, the code runs in their browsers, allowing attackers to steal data, perform actions on behalf of users, or redirect them to harmful sites.

Types:

Stored XSS: Malicious code is saved on the server.

Reflected XSS: Code is sent in a URL and executed immediately.

DOM-based XSS: Code runs when the browser modifies the page.


Protection:

Sanitize user input.

Use security headers.

Set secure cookie flags.


## USAGE?
```git clone https://github.com/spyizxa/XSS-CHECKER.git```

```cd XSS-CHECKER```

```python3 main.py```

### Enter the target site and watch what happens ;)
